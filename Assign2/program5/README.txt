In this project we are accepting the file name and the size of bytes from the user 
and display the number of bytes from file 

(Note: create a file and then write some data into the file so we can read the file)

STEPS:
1.To build the project type: make build

2.To run the file type: make ARGS="filename no.of bytes to be read from file" run
	eg: make ARGS="test.txt 10" run

3.To remove the generated executable file type: make clean

4.To get some help type: make help
